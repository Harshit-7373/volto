Removed the `FlattenToAppURLProvider` since is no longer needed @sneridagh
The components in here are meant to to need it.
Refactored the `Link` component to not use it since `react-aria-components` use the React Client Routing facilities that can be injected in the React tree.

Breaking:
  - Use the new providers in @plone/providers instead to make the new Link work with them
